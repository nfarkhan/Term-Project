                    <p class="card-text">Iranians can be a superstitious bunch, especially when it comes to being jinxed. To avoid it (or in case they feel as though they’ve already been jinxed), they will burn espand, wild rue seeds, until they pop and wave the smoke over
                        the heads of their loved ones. Because they’re also believed to have purification properties, it’s not uncommon to catch a whiff of these pleasant-smelling seeds seeping out from under your neighbour’s door.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Produce is a staple of the Iranian diet, as evidenced by their seasonal street food. Fruit is the ultimate go-to snack and it’s always offered to guests either before or after tea. While cucumbers aren’t traditionally thought of as
                        a fruit, that’s exactly what you’ll find in the bowl, neatly positioned by the pears, peaches, apricots and cherries. Now you know why that salt shaker is on the table. But technically, cucumbers are a fruit, so maybe Iranians
                        were right all along.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Taarof</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The core concept in Persian culture is called Tarof (or taarof). It is based upon acknowledgement of other people. It shows humbleness and respectfulness. For example, it is always polite to let others through a door before you, or
                        say “No, after you.” The word to use in this scenario is ‘shoma befarmayeen’ (please go ahead). Another situation in which you can come across this phenomenon is while paying at a restaurant. Everyone in the group will offer to
                        pay the bill. The appropriate word here to use is ‘nemishe’ (not possible),and of course, denying offered food and saying, “Oh, no thank you.” (in Persian: na merci) when you really do want some is customary. Most likely they will
                        insist a second time and that time you should act humbly and accept their offering.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Persian dances or Iranian dances are dance styles indigenous to Iran. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court
                        dances to energetic folk dances.</p>
