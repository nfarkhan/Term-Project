    <h1> Niiki Farkhan's Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <b><li>What is your website about?</li></b>
            My website will be about all things Iran.
            <b><li>What is the object of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</li></b>
            I think people don't know the geographic diversity or the culture of the country, they just see the news. I want to create a website to inform people.
            <b><li>Who is your target audience set?</li></b>
            Students, people who want to learn more, or even the regular person. This website is to educate.
            <b><li>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</li></b>
            I am going to have a page about the country's culture, geography, food, and a brief history.
